            <p><strong> Woburn, MA</strong> Action returned to O'Brien this week following the Four Nations Faceoff with Tommy Pöck returning to the Black team lineup and just in time to stop what appeared to be the clossing of the coffin on their season. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The week-off did not do well for Green, as they dropped their first in three weeks to a team Red who just kept with it. We'll look to get back into action following the conclusion of the MIAA tourney...</p>

            Week 18 Roundup: Shootouts, Dags Postgame Meatballs & Green Team Rolls On
            <span class="date">2/19/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Week 18:</strong> In Game 1 Red and White were both short handed, but battled hard to a 5-5 tie in a very entertaining tilt, as Manny earned Red the extra point with an impressive shoot-out move and finish! In the nightcap, Black continued to need to build Scarecrows in the locker room just to field a team! After an 11-0 start Black has become unglued, going 1-4 in their last 5. All of the sudden we have to call into question the Commitment Level of Black? Hate to believe that!!.</p>
            <p><strong>Game 1; Red 6-White 5:</strong> Red had a hard time getting their game going but trailed only 1-0 after one, as Bridgie kept them close with some nice stops. They found their stride in the 2nd though scoring 4 times! Casey Goll got them going with a 30' muffin, Stevie Salemi then turned back the clock, using those long graceful strides with an end to end beauty up where TC keeps his bongs! Chase and Salemi (again) struck late in P2, Alex Carle added Red's lone P3 tally. TC had 3 apples, Manny, Alex, Salemi, JTooms all added single helpers in the win! </p>
            <p>White got a hatty and a 5pt night from Flanny! Dags got his first of the season... His game is coming Boyz (along with his meatballs), and just in time for the Play-offs! Corey scored the 5th White goal late in the 3rd to force the shoot-out! Lasty had 3 dimes, none that made the highlight reel, but nonetheless He contributed as usual! While Dags and Corey each added single assists and had solid two-way games. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Game 2; Green 9-Black 5:</strong> Green spawned a new Law Firm of Bates-Collins & Genzler, they were buzzing throughout! All this Wagon did is account for 6 of Green's Goals and a combined for 18 pts! Genz (2g, 4a), Batesy (1g, 5a), Mike Collins (3g, 3a)... Rookie sensation Brendan Driscol continued hot with 2 ginos, while the ageless wonder Rosie buried one of his own. He also took his Annual Clapper but was stoned by Quinny...Ice the wings Rosie!! Danny Graham had two assists and I think was +7!! Breaker and Shawn Mac eached had assists, and Alex Carle showed up again in this game with another apple!.</p>
            <p>Black as mentioned is having a tough go of it lately and is also making these write-ups very difficult as they shuffle players in and out just trying to field a team! Super-sub Marty showed up to help in a big way pocketing a hat-trick! Crippsy and Austin G (#14?) each had a goal apiece! So shorthanded was Black that Robo had to drop back to the blueline, which could have been a problem because he hasn't skated backwards since the 90's! But he did pick up 2 apples as did Andy... Hamsy and Austin had single assists in the loss. Come on Black!!</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Justin Sayin'</strong> We are taking the next two weeks off. This week so all of us Pucks can watch the 4 Nations Final. Any of you American Borns get the call? US could use bodies as they appear to be made out of Glass and will be missing both Tkachuk's, McAvoy, Trocheck and maybe Matthew's! Not good!! Sounds like Black!! Note: Jamer's secured a few tables at the Great American Beer Hall in Medford for a viewing. Next Week we are off as well as the MIAA Tournament Opening Round needs our ice! So we are not back on the ice until March 6th. I suggest we make that the last week of the Regular Season as the schedule originally was set, and move right into the Play-off on 3/13. Thoughts? <strong>Just Sayin'</strong></p>

            Player of the Week (Week 17): Mike Collins
            <span class="date">2/12/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Woburn, MA - </strong>It's time to lace up and dive into the ice-cold excitement of last Thursday Nights action, where amidst the high-flying pucks and cold beers, one player stood out, stitching his name into the fabric of league legends—Mike Collins.</p>
            <p>It was the manner in which Mike dominated—part maestro, part bulldozer—dictating the pace and flow of the game with his stick and sheer will. Whether it was setting up plays or finishing them, Mike was everywhere, a haunting specter for the Red defense that might still be seeing his jersey in their sleep.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a week that saw Green steamroll a beleaguered Red Team, his synergy with Genz, each notching 2 goals and 3 assists, was nothing short of telepathic, turning the ice into their personal playground.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JD caught up with the man who turned the ice into his own personal stage, orchestrating an 11-6 thumping of the Red Team.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Mike, another dominant game with a 5-point night. How do you make it look so easy out there?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> It’s like playing pond hockey with my kids, really. With all due disrespect to the other guys, but sometimes I wonder if I accidentally signed up for a peewee league. I mean, I’m out there putting on a free clinic.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Your partnership with Genz really dismantled the Red Team today. What’s the secret sauce?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> The secret? [laughs] It's just knowing you're the best player out there. Genz and I, we just feed off the mediocrity around us. It’s about taking advantage of every mistake they make—and trust me, there are plenty.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Beyond the scoring, and the solid workout, what else do you get out of these games?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> I couldn't stand JBon and Nick continuously asking if I would come skate. Why do I continue to show up... the sheer joy of showing up and showing off. When you skate circles around guys who think they still 'got it', it fuels you. And the post game beer is cold.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> What should we expect from you and the Green Team going forward?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> I'm not here to play second fiddle to that damn Black squad. The Championship is Greens this season!</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Thanks for the candid chat, Mike. Congrats again on the win and the spectacle.</p>

            JD's Week 17 Report:
            <span class="date">2/12/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Week 17:</strong> Two High Scoring Games this week! Green fielded an impressive Roster and rolled a Red Hot Red Team who was obviously still trying to recover from Pond Hockey, 11-6. In Game 2 White found a good mix in their Roster leading to a 7-4 win over First Place Black</p>
            <p>  <strong>Green-11 Red-6</strong> Green had two very good line combinations going and broke open a tight game with 4 in the 2nd enroute to an 11-6 beating of Red. Genz (2g,3a) and Mike Collins (2g,3a) led the way with 5pt nights, while Bonny (1g,3a) and Batesy (2g,2a) had solid 4pt games to help lead the onslaught!</p>
            <p>Danny Graham was dealing from the blueline with three apples! Rookie Brendan Driscol (2g), Alex Carle (1g,1a), Breaker (2a) and Millsy (2a) all figured in the scoring with 2pt nights. Millsy may have found a home on the back end with countless silky breakout passes. Don't fight it Millsy, it's the logical progression before hanging them up! No forechecking or backchecking is also a plus! Rosie, who hasn't moved back yet, added a helper of his own and continues to turn his nose up to Mother Nature!</p>
            <p>  Red was still feeling their Pond Legs and Livers after a pretty solid showing up in NH. So bad that Salemi still wasn't able to answer the bell! Rumor has it that Coach Dolce might be in the Market and changes could be coming. Might need to start with a look in the mirror! Snake made his return with a bang netting a Hatty. Zucc had a pair of ginos and Jace added a single of his own. Apples went Jace, Jamers and Ty Whit who each had two apiece, TC, McTooms, Jim Tooms and Davey each had single assists in the loss. Time to recover Red and get ready for the stretch run! </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>White-7 Black-4</strong></p>
            <p>White had healthy scratches which appeared to create some addition by subtraction, in finding a balanced attack and taking down Black. Kellen Jones (2g,2a) remained white hot with a 4pt night. Sichaus (1g,2a) and Flanny (1g,2a) each had solid two-way games, Chad (1g,1a), Moose (1g,1a), Dags (2a) all contributed 2pt nights!</p>
            <p>  The Miller Brother's anchored a pretty stingy D with Jonny adding a dime while playing shut-down D, and Robbie continuing his solid tending! Black never could really get things going! Cooch (1g,2a), Andy (1g,2a) and Cooch (1g,2a) all had solid games, but there wasn't enough sustained pressure. Hamsy chipped in with a dime.</p>
            <p>Quinny was under siege all night, but couldn't hold off White in the end. Black needs to get healthy again in a hurry and return to early season form as the playoffs approach and will be here before we know it.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Congratulations to Robbie Miller from Team White for being named America's Player of the Week! The Team White goaltendter was a brick wall on Thursday night, making a number of robberies look routine. WHL News sat down with the former Eagle to ask him about his thoughts on POTW honor and where Team White goes from here.</p>
            <p>"It feels good. I means I wish our guys could have got the win, but that's what happens when they don't score goals. I mean, I must have had 30...40 shots from the slot.... how many times did I rob them after they dipsy doodled here and there?” Robbie explained, reflecting on his performance.</p>
            <p>Robbie also took a moment to express his gratitude: “Big thanks to my family for always being there for me and always tuning into every game on LiveBarn. And also a huge shout out and thank you to all the fans out there. The Team White faithful, you guys are [explitive] awesome.”</p>
            <p>He concluded with a subtle message to the world, “For any who may be doubting Team White, keep watching—I’m just [explitive] getting started. And to everyone else, suck it! Thanks for the extra motivation. It’s not over until I say it is. I'll carry this whole damn team on my back if I must!”</p>

            Behind Team Greens Win: Mrs. Driscoll’s Buffalo Chicken Dip, The Real MVP of Green’s Victory

          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>WOBURN, MA –</strong> Some teams rely on skill, others on strategy—but Team Green had Mrs. Driscoll’s Buffalo Chicken Dip, and that made all the difference.</p>
            <p>"From the moment we stepped on the ice, we knew what was waiting for us in the locker room—pure, cheesy, spicy perfection. There was no way we were losing. Every pass, every shot, every shift was powered by the promise of that legendary dip," said Green Team Defensman Kieth 'Breaker' Acoin. "To be completely honest, I might have told the guys my back hurt if I didn't think the dip would be here," he added.</p>
            <p>Capt. Danny G also sent his compliments to the chef, adding, "To you, Mrs. Driscoll: thank you! Your dip wasn’t just a snack—it was motivation, fuel, and the real MVP of the night. Future opponents, take note—if that dip is in the building, you’re already in trouble."</p>

            <p>WOBURN, MA – Week 16: Only one game on the Docket in Wk 16 as Christmas in February (Pond Hockey) took center stage for Red leaving Black without an opponent.</p>
            <p>In the lone match-up, Green outlasted White 6-4 in a fast paced affair. Robbie Miller stood on his head making about 40 saves, but unfortunately ended up on the short end!</p>
            <p>Green had their offense humming but as mentioned ran into some solid tending. They got a hatty from Rookie of the Year Candidate Brendan Driscol, the 3rd being a chisel into an empty net! Bonny is teaching him well!!</p>
            <p>Batesy and Mike Collins also pocketed a gino each for Green. Assists went to Rosie with three, Genz and Batesy with two apiece, Bonnie and Mike Collins with one each.<p/>
            <p>White was down a few bodies but did get a boost and some much needed speed with Yano coming off the IR. They got goals from Jonesy, Sichuan, Flanny and Lasty. Lasty's 7th of the year was as usual of the greasy variety, off some body part. Amazingly I don't believe one of his goals have actually come off his stick this season or has He been further than 10 inches from the net front. Flanny dished out two apples while Corey, Yano, Jonesy, and Dags added singles. Dags showed a flash from the past with an end to end thriller, but was all Swede no Finnish... It's coming Dags! Great Tending Robbie!!</p>

            The Dream Killers: How Wives Are Ruining Men's League Hockey
            <span class="date">1/24/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p>Ever wonder why men’s league hockey isn’t as electrifying as it could be? Look no further than the culprits sitting right across from you at the dinner table. Yes, I’m talking about the wives—the so-called ‘dream killers’ of men’s league hockey. Now, before you label me as a heretic, hear me out.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time, these guys were young, wild, and free—tearing up the ice, fueled by nothing but dreams and cheap beer. Then came the wife, with sensible suggestions like “Maybe you should take it easy,” and “Don’t you think you’re a bit old for this?” Suddenly, those dreams of glory were replaced by nightmarish visions of early bedtimes and endless honey-do lists.</p>
            <p>It’s not just the dreams they’re killing; it’s the raw, untamed freedom that comes with a stick, a puck, and a rink full of like-minded warriors. Every “Be careful!” chips away at the edgy spirit needed to dive face-first into the boards or laugh in the face of a high-sticking. And let’s not forget the ultimate sacrifice—missed games for couple’s yoga or fancy dinner parties. The horror!</p>
            <p>What happened to the days of nursing injuries with pride and choosing a playoff game over a wedding anniversary? Gone—replaced by vet appointments and family obligations. So here’s to the wives: may your dreams of a cautious, responsible husband be as crushed as ours are every time you suggest he "just" skips the skate.</p>

            League Buzz: Thomas Pöck Spotted in Black Team Locker Room, Fueling Comeback Rumors
            <span class="date">1/16/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p>In a surprising turn of events, former NHL defenseman Thomas Pöck was recently spotted in the Black Team's locker room following last week’s game, sparking widespread speculation about his potential return from injured reserve (IR). Known for his dynamic playing style and offensive capabilities, Pöck reportedly enjoyed time with the boys.</p>
            <p>The sighting occurred shortly before the Black Team's scheduled practice, where he was seen engaging in light workouts and discussions with the coaching staff. This unexpected appearance has led to rumors suggesting that the veteran might be eyeing a comeback.</p>
            <p>While details about his injury and recovery remain scarce, Pöck's presence has ignited hope among fans and teammates alike. The team's spokesperson has yet to confirm any official plans for his return.</p>
            <p>It’s also been noted that Tom’s return—and Team Black's failure to field a full roster the previous week—might not be coincidental. Looks like they're here to play.</p>
