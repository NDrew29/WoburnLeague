    WHL Player of the Week: T.C. Harris – Leader, Playmaker, Culinary Weapon
    <span class="date">12/05/2025</span>
  </h2>

  <div class="feed-content">
    <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> The WHL does not hand out a lot of praise. But once in a while, a man steps forward and delivers a performance so complete, so dominant, so essential to league morale that the accolade becomes obvious.</p>

    <p>This week, that man is <strong>T.C. Harris</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>On the ice</strong>, T.C. <strong> was </strong>WHL excellence — steady shifts, smart plays, and played the kind of two-way that will make a hockey coach pitch a tent in his track suit.</p>

    <p><strong>The biggest stat of his night?</strong> This absolute beauty rolled into the rink not once but <em>twice</em> in two weeks with food for the boys. Last week he brought homemade dishes to feed the locker room, and last night he delivered a batch of <strong>meatballs so good they registered as scoring chances.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>T.C. didn’t just play the game — he nourished the locker room.</strong></p>

    <p>In a world where some teams in the WHL mail it in, this man arrives with a <strong>slow cooker and a purpose.</strong> That’s leadership you can F'n taste.</p>

    <p><strong>Congratulations to T.C. Harris, WHL Week 2 Player of the Week.</strong><br>
    A playmaker. A provider. A fucking beauty.</p>

    WHL Week 2 Recap: Red Rolls, White Wakes Up, and Green & Black Embarrass Themselves
    <span class="date">12/5/2025</span>
  </h2>

  <div class="feed-content">
    <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> Week 2 of the WHL did not disappoint. Unless, of course, you played for Green or Black — in which case puking on your own rod would’ve been a statistical improvement over whatever that performance was. Red brought sober bodies, and White clearly went out and did some summer recruiting.</p>

    <p><strong>Game 1: Red 6, Black 2</strong><br>
    After coughing up a shootout loss last week, Red hit the ice like a team that was tired of hearing chirps about “closing games.” They answered by pumping six past Black, who came out with all the defensive structure of wet cardboard got folks in the media asking ... is team Black washed??.</p>

    <p>Black’s Week 1 swagger evaporated quickly as Red’s forwards danced through them like a Billerica Ballerina. Dominant win for Red, humbling reality check for Black.</p>

    <p><strong>Game 2: White 5, Green 3</strong><br>
    White must’ve taken Week 1 personally, because they rolled into Week 2 playing like they actually belonged in this league, even with Captian Flanigan calling out with a tummy ache...</p>

    <p>Green, meanwhile, looked like a team still high (see what we did there...) off their Week 1 shootout win — except this time there was no shootout magic, just a civ in goal, apple-turnovers, and blown coverages. White took advantage every chance they got and skated off with their first win on the season.</p>

    <p><strong>The Standings After Week 2:</strong>  
    Red sits alone in first place, while White, Black and Green form a perfectly mediocre three-way tie. While every team now has a win, every team now has questions heading into a momumental Week 3.</p>

    <p><strong>What to Watch Heading Into Week 3:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Can Black rebound?</strong> Or is this who they are now ?</li>
      <li><strong>Will Green figure out their shit out?</strong> Or do we just accept the chaos and move on?</li>
      <li><strong>Is Red’s competence here to stay?</strong> Or was this one sober Thursday night miracle?</li>
      <li><strong>Can White stay hot?</strong> or will lack of a Flanigan in the locker room prove too costly?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The WHL rolls into Week 3 next Thursday.</strong> </p>

              Opening Night in the WHL: Fresh Ice, Old Grudges, and a Two-Game Heater

              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> The Zamboni is fueled, the beers are on ice, and the group chats are already one chirp away from mutiny. That can only mean one thing: <strong>it’s Opening Night in the Woburn Hockey League!</strong></p>
          
              <p>This Thursday at O’Brien Rink, the WHL drops the puck on a brand-new season with a slate of first round Playoff rematches: <strong>Game 1 features Black vs White at 9:00 PM</strong> followed by <strong>Game 2 Green vs Red at 10:00 PM</strong>. Every team starts at 0–0, but if you’ve read a single email last April, you know the egos are already mid-season form.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Last Year’s Storyline:</strong> Team White closed the book on 2025 by steamrolling their way to the championship, leaving Green, Black and Red to spend the summer explaining to their families how “the bounces” and “attendance issues” were to blame. White now comes in wearing the crown, the target, and, allegedly, custom “Champions” T-shirts...</p>
          
              <p><strong>New Season, Same Drama:</strong> Green is out for revenge after watching White celebrate all summer. Black wants to prove their early-season wagon days weren’t a one-hit wonder. Red is promising “more commitment” this year, which probably means at least two lines showing up on time and one or two more Temazcal margs before puck drop.</p>
          
              <p><strong>What to Watch Tonight:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Rust vs. Hustle:</strong> Who spent the offseason in the gym and who spent it in the beer garden? We’ll find out by the first TV timeout… if we had TV timeouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Bench Chemistry:</strong> New lines, new subs, same old excuses. Expect at least three crash-outs on the refs before the second period.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>Fans, family and friends are all invited to come down and watch opening night hockey in Woburn.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Welcome back to the WHL.</strong> The chase for this year’s title starts tonight at 9:00 PM in Woburn.</p>

              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> #4 SEED WHITE TAKES 2024-25 WSHL TITLE 7-2!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>White 7 Green 2:</strong> White left no doubt by jumping on Green for 4-unanswered goals in P1 while cruising to a 7-2 W and the WSHL Title! Flanny (4pts 1g, 3a) got the scoring going midway through the period with Jonesy assisting. Just 34 seconds later Matt Sieckhaus tallied to make it 2-0, Lasty and Chad with helpers. The score stayed that way until late in P1 when White struck for another two quick ones which appeared to put this one out of reach. First Jonesy (4pts 1g,3a) made it 3-0 with apples going to Lasty and Flanny, then with just 46 seconds left in the period Chad delivered the dagger with the Flanny Brothers providing help! Dags took over from there scoring the next three and a natty hatty, his first one a wrong footed off wing snipe showing he still has some game, his third one a World Class Chisel that only Bonny could be proud of, into an empty net in front of his Family. Jonesy (2), Jonny Miller, Flanny and Rob Fiorintino had the dimes for Dags! Robbie Miller stood tall as usual and earned a share of the Hart Trophy Award for the Playoff MVP, splitting it with Jonesy. Green never did quite recover from the P1 onslaught although Brendan Driscol did cut the score to 4-1 for a brief  moment early in P2 with Danny Graham and Breaker adding assists. Brendan added another marker in the third with Alex Carle and Shawn Mac assisting, but it was too little too late for Green at that point. They never were able to solve Lou Amerello's Center Ice Trap that turned the NHL into a yawner in the early 2000's! </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Just Sayin'</strong> I would say the League ended quite a bit better than it started when teams were struggling to get bodies to even field squads! There is a good nucleus of players there that hopefully can keep the League vibrant. Maybe they can get a few other full time commitments from some buddies. Hate to see those solid hours go unused by the WSHL! <strong>Just Sayin'</strong></p>

        Team White Triumphs in 2025 WHL Championship: Emails and Egos Fuel the Fire to Victory
        <span class="date">4/22/2025</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="feed-content">
        <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> The 2025 Woburn Hockey League (WHL) Championship is officially in the books, and Team White stands tall after sweeping Team Green in a series that can only be described as a masterclass in hockey, drama, and pure chaotic energy. From the ice to the inbox, this season’s finale wasn’t just about playing for the cup—it was about proving a point, airing grievances, and firing up the squad with a healthy dose of email banter.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Championship Showdown: A Sweep to Remember</strong></p>
        <p>In the championship series, Team White's blend of tactical genius and raw determination was on full display. Game One was a masterclass in defensive strategy, ending in a 4-2 victory that set the tone for the finals. Game Two saw Team White dismantle Team Green with a resounding 7 to 2 victory, a testament to their depth and resilience under pressure.</p>
        <p></p>
         <p>Key players? Well, Robbie Miller was his usual brick-wall self in net, stopping everything that came his way. Flanny opened the scoring with a beauty in Game One, a snipe that set the tone for the rest of the series. And let’s not forget the steady presence of the defense: Jon, Cory, and Rob, whose collective calm under pressure helped neutralize Team Green’s high-powered offense. Dags’ GWG in Game One? <strong>Pure magic</strong>.</p>
        <p>And speaking of magic, could this be the year of Kellen Jones? With a seven-point game to kick-off the playoffs and an unwavering leadership presence throughout, Jones was the heartbeat of Team White’s offensive resurgence. Jones had this to say following the victory "What did I tell you, JD? Put us on the ice, and we'll show you how it's done. This isn't just a win; it's a statement. We talked about it, we dreamed about it, and here we are—champions. Let the doubters doubt; we're too busy winning."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The Emails: The Real MVPs</strong></p>
        <p>The heart of Team White’s success this season might’ve actually been found in their inboxes. Email chains became the secret sauce for motivation. Not just any emails— these were savage, fiery, and full of enough energy to power an entire season’s worth of hot showers. Even if your inboxes at home weren't full with the latest "[EXT] [EXT] Re: [EXT] Re: [EXT] Re: League Status" email, just a one look at play on the ice would have indicated the full effect of what came through the inbox threads.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Tactical Genius</strong></p>
        <p>The email chains often contained gems that turned into motivational mantras. Some contained tactical discussions disguised as taunts. A memorable line from Flanny during the playoffs, "Guess Smotherman is also in today too. Thanks for letting us know, Robo." reflected the cerebral approach Team White took to each game, turning their email threads into a tool for mental and strategic preparation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Looking Ahead: More Than Just a Game</strong></p>
        <p>As Team White looks to the future, the legacy of their 2025 championship run will be defined by their skill, unity, and the unique way they used Microsoft Outlook. The team’s ability to turn words into action and challenges into championships sets a high bar for the next season.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Congratulations to Team White on their well-earned championship, proving that in hockey, as in life, the right words can indeed lead to the ultimate victory.</p>

              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> The Finals got underway with a Play-off Style tilt that included a fast pace, low scoring, tight checking and also some tamborine hands! White played an effective Team D style and were able to hold high flying Green to just 2 goals when they had averaged 6+ in the regular Season and were averaging 8 in the Playoffs!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>White 4 Green 2:</strong> White got solid tending form Robbie Miller and some stingy Team D to frustrate Green while finding enough scoring to earn a 4-2 W. Flanny got things going midway through the first with a snipe, Chappy and Chad with apples. After Green tied things late in the second White responded just a minute and a half later when Rob Fiorentino found the back of the net with helpers from Chappy and Flanny. Dags got his first of the Play-offs with just over 4 minutes left in regulation which turned out to be the GWG... Lasty and Kellen Jones picked up assists. Chad was able to chisel an empty netter just before time ran out, with Rob Fiorentino helping. Robbie Miller was in usual Playoff form standing tall in the cage! Solid D from Jonny, Dougie, Cory and Rob...Green couldn't get their high scoring O going and was frustrated at almost every turn! After being held scoreless in P1, Mike Collins took a nice feed from Danny Furlong to tie the game late in the P2. They found themselves down a pair when Danny Graham pulled them within one with just over 3-minutes remaining, Bonny and Genz assisting. But Green could not find the equalizer with Nicky Drew pulled. Defense and tending were solid for Green as well, just could get that O ignited! </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Just Sayin'</strong> White is one win away from the WSHL Title and bragging rights! Something tells me Lasty already has his email tee'd up! Green will be looking for some combos at Thursday's Morning Skate to see if they can get their offense going. Something tells me they'll be buzzing!! <strong>Just Sayin'</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> White and Black engaged in a very spirited game that had a little of everything with White knocking off Top-seed Black 4-3 with a late 3rd period goal!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>#4 White 4 / #1 Black 3:</strong> White showed some moxie overcoming a late 2nd period 2-goal deficit and then scored the only goal of the third to move onto the finals! Jonesy remained on a heater with 2 goals and an assist! His 2nd goal with just over 2-minutes remaining was a beauty in which Chappy fed Yano for a touch pass to spring Jonsey for the GWG. Yano was back in the line-up after multiple healthy scratches and made his presence felt! Boy we missed those long graceful strides and his unwavering sportsmanship! Moose got White's first, Jonesy and Chappy got them back in it and tied going into the 3rd, where they were able to pocket the game winner. Dags moved up to forward and had two dimes, Chappy (2pts), Corey and Yano all assisted for the winners. Jonny Miller played 30 minutes and Robbie was in his usual Play-off form in net to back bone White's stingy D. Black started strong with Cripsy's 2, his second had some deft 40' sauce from Kooch! Danny Mac made a steal and split the White D for a break-away goal midway through the 2nd and put Black up 3-1 and casting doubt. But they couldn't hold the fort  as White scored the last three and the top-seed was dispatched! Kooch had two assists and Rhett had one in the loss. Quinny was back between the pipes and helped turn this one into a tenders duel.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Just Sayin'</strong> Lasty and Robo both played in this 3-game series! But you'd have to look at the email chains to know that!

              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> Green gutted out a win and a sweep of #2 Red who was rolling three full lines! In the night cap Black starved off elimination with a trademark stingy defense that we saw early on in the season. Game 3 this Thursday 4/3 @ 9:00. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>#3 Green / #2 Red 4:</strong> Green was not to be denied as evident by Bonny's 2 blocks, which are believed to be the 1st two of his career. Bonny also figured in the scoring with two Gino's. Mike Collins also had two goals (3pts) while Batesy, Danny Furlong and Danny Graham contributed a goal and an apple apiece. Breaker, Brendan Driscoll, Shawn Mac and Alex Carle all added single helpers. It should be noted that Green got 6pts from the Blueline Corps adding a much needed offensive boost. Outside of a 4 minute stretch at the end of P2, Nicky Drew was almost unbeatable. Red never could get in a rhythm rolling three full! They did make a game of it with three goals in a 4 minute span late in the 2nd, but could never quite get over the hump! TC who always elevates his game at Play-off Time had a Hatty. Ty Whinet added a goal as well. Zucc got held without a goal, which is a rarity, but he did contribute with three dimes! McTooms, Jace and Jamers each added an assist.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>#1 Black 4 / #4 White 1:</strong> Black reverted back to their stingy defense that carried them to an 11-0 start to the Season. They were able to muster enough offense led by Cripsy with two goals and a 3pt night! Rhett remained hot adding a goal and an assist. Bill Caribino chiseled an empty netter to round out the scoring. Kyle Mac had a pair of assists of his own! Kevin McGinty was between the pipes for Black and stood tall! White got their lone goal from Flanny with Moose and Jonesy assisting. This one was close throughout (1-1 after one, 2-1 after two) and could have swung had Flanny's Post early in the 3rd found its way in! Hard to believe that White was held to one goal after their 9-goal output in Game 1. </p>

              <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Oh, top notch. My wife's definitely snagged the league's MVP—lucky her, right? She’s got the best, and she knows it!</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>JD:</strong> What should the others expect in the finals?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>KJ:</strong> A show, pure and simple. They better step up or step aside. We’re not letting up on Black. I expect to walk over them, even Tommy can't save them if I'm on the ice.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>JD:</strong> Celebration plans for tonight?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>KJ:</strong> The usual— winning isn't new to me. Hot shower and cold beers, loud laughs with the boys, making the other guys wish they were me.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>JD:</strong> Any final thoughts for the fans?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Just keep watching and cheering. We feel the love and it fuels us. To everyone else, keep your heads up—my line’s just heating up and we’re not cooling down anytime soon.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>JD:</strong> Thanks for the insights, Kellen. Stellar game tonight.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>KJ:</strong> Anytime, JD. Let’s do this again after we lift the cup, yeah?</p>

            Playoffs - Game 1 Round-Ups!
            <span class="date">3/20/2025</span>
          </h2>
            <div class="feed-content">
              <p><strong>Woburn, MA –</strong> Both Games featured mild upsets as both the #1 & #2 Seeds were put on the brink of elimination in very high scoring affairs that saw 25 goals combined! </p>
              <p><strong>Game 1 #4 White 9 / #1 Black 3: </strong>  White gave up a goal in the first minute but regrouped quickly and ran off the next 5 enroute to a 9-3 whitewash of #1 Seeded Black. </p>
              <p>White was led by the Law Firm of Flanigan, Jones and Filtreau who combined for 7 goals and 17 Points! Kellen Jones led the attack with a 7-pt night with possibly a WSHL Record 3 goals and 4 assists. On any other night, Flanny's (3g,2a) & Chad's (1g,4a) 5-pt nights would have been considered solid efforts, but not in Game 1. </p>
              <p>Matt Sickhaus who had a solid night at the face-off dot added a gino, as did Moose! Corey and Dags were solid on D and added a pair of apples apiece to help pace White! Note: Lasty played! Perennial Vezina Finalist Robbie Miller was his usual stubborn self and frustrated Black. Black got a solid 3pt performance from Rhett Bly (2g,1a) but it simply wasn't enough on this night! Danny Mac (1g,1a) and Cripsy (2a) had 2pts each, and Hamsy added an assist from the backline. But Black had no answer for the Law Firm this week!</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Game 2 #3 Green 9 / #2 Red 4: </strong> Green found a nice combination as well to enter in their own Law Firm Version as Bonny, Genz and Driscol combined for 14-pts while pacing Green to a convincing 9-4 W. </p>
              <p>This one looked every bit the track meet after a combined 7 goal first period. But Green settled in and outscored Red 5-1 the rest of the way! Bonny turned back the WSHL Clock with a 6pt (3g,3a) game. </p>
              <p>Genz had his typical trick and even added a rare dime for a 4pt (3g,1a) night, and Brendan Driscoll had 4 assists for their top line! Genz made it through to the altar with his grill intact and I'm sure his Fiance' appreciates that!! </p>
              <p>Alex Carle (3pts) stepped up huge with some welcomed production off the blueline with 2 goals and an assist. Batesy (3pts) added three dimes but probably deserved more as He hunted and controlled the puck consistently! Danny Graham (1g,1a) and Shawn Mac (2a) made for a very effective line! Breaker and Danny Furlong each added a helper and were stingy on the back end. Red started strong and was within striking distance after P1, but couldn't muster any sustained pressure on Green beyond that. Zucc (1g,2a) had his customary multi point game. Salemi (1g,1a), McTooms and Jared Melello added ginos, Jace and Casey added single assists for Red. Probably could use a dose of Manny in Game 2! </p>
              <br>

            Week 18 Roundup: Shootouts, Dags Postgame Meatballs & Green Team Rolls On
            <span class="date">2/19/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Week 18:</strong> In Game 1 Red and White were both short handed, but battled hard to a 5-5 tie in a very entertaining tilt, as Manny earned Red the extra point with an impressive shoot-out move and finish! In the nightcap, Black continued to need to build Scarecrows in the locker room just to field a team! After an 11-0 start Black has become unglued, going 1-4 in their last 5. All of the sudden we have to call into question the Commitment Level of Black? Hate to believe that!!.</p>
            <p><strong>Game 1; Red 6-White 5:</strong> Red had a hard time getting their game going but trailed only 1-0 after one, as Bridgie kept them close with some nice stops. They found their stride in the 2nd though scoring 4 times! Casey Goll got them going with a 30' muffin, Stevie Salemi then turned back the clock, using those long graceful strides with an end to end beauty up where TC keeps his bongs! Chase and Salemi (again) struck late in P2, Alex Carle added Red's lone P3 tally. TC had 3 apples, Manny, Alex, Salemi, JTooms all added single helpers in the win! </p>
            <p>White got a hatty and a 5pt night from Flanny! Dags got his first of the season... His game is coming Boyz (along with his meatballs), and just in time for the Play-offs! Corey scored the 5th White goal late in the 3rd to force the shoot-out! Lasty had 3 dimes, none that made the highlight reel, but nonetheless He contributed as usual! While Dags and Corey each added single assists and had solid two-way games. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Game 2; Green 9-Black 5:</strong> Green spawned a new Law Firm of Bates-Collins & Genzler, they were buzzing throughout! All this Wagon did is account for 6 of Green's Goals and a combined for 18 pts! Genz (2g, 4a), Batesy (1g, 5a), Mike Collins (3g, 3a)... Rookie sensation Brendan Driscol continued hot with 2 ginos, while the ageless wonder Rosie buried one of his own. He also took his Annual Clapper but was stoned by Quinny...Ice the wings Rosie!! Danny Graham had two assists and I think was +7!! Breaker and Shawn Mac eached had assists, and Alex Carle showed up again in this game with another apple!.</p>
            <p>Black as mentioned is having a tough go of it lately and is also making these write-ups very difficult as they shuffle players in and out just trying to field a team! Super-sub Marty showed up to help in a big way pocketing a hat-trick! Crippsy and Austin G (#14?) each had a goal apiece! So shorthanded was Black that Robo had to drop back to the blueline, which could have been a problem because he hasn't skated backwards since the 90's! But he did pick up 2 apples as did Andy... Hamsy and Austin had single assists in the loss. Come on Black!!</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Justin Sayin'</strong> We are taking the next two weeks off. This week so all of us Pucks can watch the 4 Nations Final. Any of you American Borns get the call? US could use bodies as they appear to be made out of Glass and will be missing both Tkachuk's, McAvoy, Trocheck and maybe Matthew's! Not good!! Sounds like Black!! Note: Jamer's secured a few tables at the Great American Beer Hall in Medford for a viewing. Next Week we are off as well as the MIAA Tournament Opening Round needs our ice! So we are not back on the ice until March 6th. I suggest we make that the last week of the Regular Season as the schedule originally was set, and move right into the Play-off on 3/13. Thoughts? <strong>Just Sayin'</strong></p>

            Player of the Week (Week 17): Mike Collins
            <span class="date">2/12/2025</span>

          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Woburn, MA - </strong>It's time to lace up and dive into the ice-cold excitement of last Thursday Nights action, where amidst the high-flying pucks and cold beers, one player stood out, stitching his name into the fabric of league legends—Mike Collins.</p>
            <p>It was the manner in which Mike dominated—part maestro, part bulldozer—dictating the pace and flow of the game with his stick and sheer will. Whether it was setting up plays or finishing them, Mike was everywhere, a haunting specter for the Red defense that might still be seeing his jersey in their sleep.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In a week that saw Green steamroll a beleaguered Red Team, his synergy with Genz, each notching 2 goals and 3 assists, was nothing short of telepathic, turning the ice into their personal playground.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JD caught up with the man who turned the ice into his own personal stage, orchestrating an 11-6 thumping of the Red Team.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Mike, another dominant game with a 5-point night. How do you make it look so easy out there?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> It’s like playing pond hockey with my kids, really. With all due disrespect to the other guys, but sometimes I wonder if I accidentally signed up for a peewee league. I mean, I’m out there putting on a free clinic.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Your partnership with Genz really dismantled the Red Team today. What’s the secret sauce?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> The secret? [laughs] It's just knowing you're the best player out there. Genz and I, we just feed off the mediocrity around us. It’s about taking advantage of every mistake they make—and trust me, there are plenty.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Beyond the scoring, and the solid workout, what else do you get out of these games?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> I couldn't stand JBon and Nick continuously asking if I would come skate. Why do I continue to show up... the sheer joy of showing up and showing off. When you skate circles around guys who think they still 'got it', it fuels you. And the post game beer is cold.</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> What should we expect from you and the Green Team going forward?</p>
            <p>  <strong>Mike Collins:</strong> I'm not here to play second fiddle to that damn Black squad. The Championship is Greens this season!</p>
            <p>  <strong>JD:</strong> Thanks for the candid chat, Mike. Congrats again on the win and the spectacle.</p>

            <span class="date">2/12/2025</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="feed-content">
            <p><strong>Week 17:</strong> Two High Scoring Games this week! Green fielded an impressive Roster and rolled a Red Hot Red Team who was obviously still trying to recover from Pond Hockey, 11-6. In Game 2 White found a good mix in their Roster leading to a 7-4 win over First Place Black</p>
            <p>  <strong>Green-11 Red-6</strong> Green had two very good line combinations going and broke open a tight game with 4 in the 2nd enroute to an 11-6 beating of Red. Genz (2g,3a) and Mike Collins (2g,3a) led the way with 5pt nights, while Bonny (1g,3a) and Batesy (2g,2a) had solid 4pt games to help lead the onslaught!</p>
            <p>Danny Graham was dealing from the blueline with three apples! Rookie Brendan Driscol (2g), Alex Carle (1g,1a), Breaker (2a) and Millsy (2a) all figured in the scoring with 2pt nights. Millsy may have found a home on the back end with countless silky breakout passes. Don't fight it Millsy, it's the logical progression before hanging them up! No forechecking or backchecking is also a plus! Rosie, who hasn't moved back yet, added a helper of his own and continues to turn his nose up to Mother Nature!</p>
            <p>  Red was still feeling their Pond Legs and Livers after a pretty solid showing up in NH. So bad that Salemi still wasn't able to answer the bell! Rumor has it that Coach Dolce might be in the Market and changes could be coming. Might need to start with a look in the mirror! Snake made his return with a bang netting a Hatty. Zucc had a pair of ginos and Jace added a single of his own. Apples went Jace, Jamers and Ty Whit who each had two apiece, TC, McTooms, Jim Tooms and Davey each had single assists in the loss. Time to recover Red and get ready for the stretch run! </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>White-7 Black-4</strong></p>
            <p>White had healthy scratches which appeared to create some addition by subtraction, in finding a balanced attack and taking down Black. Kellen Jones (2g,2a) remained white hot with a 4pt night. Sichaus (1g,2a) and Flanny (1g,2a) each had solid two-way games, Chad (1g,1a), Moose (1g,1a), Dags (2a) all contributed 2pt nights!</p>
            <p>  The Miller Brother's anchored a pretty stingy D with Jonny adding a dime while playing shut-down D, and Robbie continuing his solid tending! Black never could really get things going! Cooch (1g,2a), Andy (1g,2a) and Cooch (1g,2a) all had solid games, but there wasn't enough sustained pressure. Hamsy chipped in with a dime.</p>
            <p>Quinny was under siege all night, but couldn't hold off White in the end. Black needs to get healthy again in a hurry and return to early season form as the playoffs approach and will be here before we know it.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Congratulations to Robbie Miller from Team White for being named America's Player of the Week! The Team White goaltendter was a brick wall on Thursday night, making a number of robberies look routine. WHL News sat down with the former Eagle to ask him about his thoughts on POTW honor and where Team White goes from here.</p>
            <p>"It feels good. I means I wish our guys could have got the win, but that's what happens when they don't score goals. I mean, I must have had 30...40 shots from the slot.... how many times did I rob them after they dipsy doodled here and there?” Robbie explained, reflecting on his performance.</p>
            <p>Robbie also took a moment to express his gratitude: “Big thanks to my family for always being there for me and always tuning into every game on LiveBarn. And also a huge shout out and thank you to all the fans out there. The Team White faithful, you guys are [explitive] awesome.”</p>
            <p>He concluded with a subtle message to the world, “For any who may be doubting Team White, keep watching—I’m just [explitive] getting started. And to everyone else, suck it! Thanks for the extra motivation. It’s not over until I say it is. I'll carry this whole damn team on my back if I must!”</p>

            Behind Team Greens Win: Mrs. Driscoll’s Buffalo Chicken Dip, The Real MVP of Green’s Victory

            <p><strong>WOBURN, MA –</strong> Some teams rely on skill, others on strategy—but Team Green had Mrs. Driscoll’s Buffalo Chicken Dip, and that made all the difference.</p>
            <p>"From the moment we stepped on the ice, we knew what was waiting for us in the locker room—pure, cheesy, spicy perfection. There was no way we were losing. Every pass, every shot, every shift was powered by the promise of that legendary dip," said Green Team Defensman Kieth 'Breaker' Acoin. "To be completely honest, I might have told the guys my back hurt if I didn't think the dip would be here," he added.</p>
            <p>Capt. Danny G also sent his compliments to the chef, adding, "To you, Mrs. Driscoll: thank you! Your dip wasn’t just a snack—it was motivation, fuel, and the real MVP of the night. Future opponents, take note—if that dip is in the building, you’re already in trouble."</p>

            <p>WOBURN, MA – Week 16: Only one game on the Docket in Wk 16 as Christmas in February (Pond Hockey) took center stage for Red leaving Black without an opponent.</p>
            <p>In the lone match-up, Green outlasted White 6-4 in a fast paced affair. Robbie Miller stood on his head making about 40 saves, but unfortunately ended up on the short end!</p>
            <p>Green had their offense humming but as mentioned ran into some solid tending. They got a hatty from Rookie of the Year Candidate Brendan Driscol, the 3rd being a chisel into an empty net! Bonny is teaching him well!!</p>
            <p>Batesy and Mike Collins also pocketed a gino each for Green. Assists went to Rosie with three, Genz and Batesy with two apiece, Bonnie and Mike Collins with one each.<p/>
            <p>White was down a few bodies but did get a boost and some much needed speed with Yano coming off the IR. They got goals from Jonesy, Sichuan, Flanny and Lasty. Lasty's 7th of the year was as usual of the greasy variety, off some body part. Amazingly I don't believe one of his goals have actually come off his stick this season or has He been further than 10 inches from the net front. Flanny dished out two apples while Corey, Yano, Jonesy, and Dags added singles. Dags showed a flash from the past with an end to end thriller, but was all Swede no Finnish... It's coming Dags! Great Tending Robbie!!</p>

            <p>Ever wonder why men’s league hockey isn’t as electrifying as it could be? Look no further than the culprits sitting right across from you at the dinner table. Yes, I’m talking about the wives—the so-called ‘dream killers’ of men’s league hockey. Now, before you label me as a heretic, hear me out.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time, these guys were young, wild, and free—tearing up the ice, fueled by nothing but dreams and cheap beer. Then came the wife, with sensible suggestions like “Maybe you should take it easy,” and “Don’t you think you’re a bit old for this?” Suddenly, those dreams of glory were replaced by nightmarish visions of early bedtimes and endless honey-do lists.</p>
            <p>It’s not just the dreams they’re killing; it’s the raw, untamed freedom that comes with a stick, a puck, and a rink full of like-minded warriors. Every “Be careful!” chips away at the edgy spirit needed to dive face-first into the boards or laugh in the face of a high-sticking. And let’s not forget the ultimate sacrifice—missed games for couple’s yoga or fancy dinner parties. The horror!</p>
            <p>What happened to the days of nursing injuries with pride and choosing a playoff game over a wedding anniversary? Gone—replaced by vet appointments and family obligations. So here’s to the wives: may your dreams of a cautious, responsible husband be as crushed as ours are every time you suggest he "just" skips the skate.</p>

            <p>Congratulations to Rhett Bly from Team Black for being named America's Player of the Week!</p>
            <p>The Team Black forward had this to say about such a monumental achievement: "I just gotta get pucks in and be hard on loose pucks."</p>
            <p>Bly added, “Alright, buckle up—it’s about to get real. Big thanks to the big guy upstairs for not totally screwing me over... yet... and major props to my wife and kids. It’s great to let them know I still [explitive] got it. Winning ‘Player of the Week’? Hell, no offense to the rest of the grocery sticks here, but it’s like being the smartest kid in detention. I’d be in the show right now, but I’m not a glory hound. So here’s to being a big fish in this glorified kiddie pool—and cheers to me! This old dog is still showing the pups how it’s done!”</p>

            League Buzz: Thomas Pöck Spotted in Black Team Locker Room, Fueling Comeback Rumors
            <span class="date">1/16/2025</span>

          <div class="feed-content">
            <p>In a surprising turn of events, former NHL defenseman Thomas Pöck was recently spotted in the Black Team's locker room following last week’s game, sparking widespread speculation about his potential return from injured reserve (IR). Known for his dynamic playing style and offensive capabilities, Pöck reportedly enjoyed time with the boys.</p>
            <p>The sighting occurred shortly before the Black Team's scheduled practice, where he was seen engaging in light workouts and discussions with the coaching staff. This unexpected appearance has led to rumors suggesting that the veteran might be eyeing a comeback.</p>
            <p>While details about his injury and recovery remain scarce, Pöck's presence has ignited hope among fans and teammates alike. The team's spokesperson has yet to confirm any official plans for his return.</p>
            <p>It’s also been noted that Tom’s return—and Team Black's failure to field a full roster the previous week—might not be coincidental. Looks like they're here to play.</p>
