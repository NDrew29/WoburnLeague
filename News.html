            <h3>League Buzz: Thomas Pöck Spotted in Black Team Locker Room, Fueling Comeback Rumors</h3>
            <p>In a surprising turn of events, former NHL defenseman Thomas Pöck was recently spotted in the Black Team's locker room following last weeks game, sparking widespread speculation about his potential return from the injured reserve (IR). Pöck, known for his dynamic playing style and offensive capabilities, reportedly enjoyed time with the boys.
The sighting occurred shortly before the Black Team's scheduled practice session, where Pöck was seen engaging in what appeared to be light workouts and discussions with coaching staff. This unexpected appearance has led to rumors circulating through the league, suggesting that the veteran might be eyeing a comeback.
While details of his injury and recovery timeline remain scarce, Pöck's presence in the locker room has ignited hope among fans and teammates alike. The team's spokesperson has yet to confirm any official plans for his return, leaving many to wonder about the possibilities of seeing Pöck back in action.
Its also been reported that Toms return and team Blacks failure to field a full roster the previous week is also not coincidental. Looks like they're here to play. </p>
